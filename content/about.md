Antenna scans artifacts of a project, downloads sources for dependencies, validates sources and licenses and creates:

    - a third-party disclosure document that lists all dependencies with their licenses
    - an artifact information \*.csv-file containing a list of the artifacts coordinate and license data
    - a sources.zip containing all sources of the dependencies
    - a processing report.

Additionally, Antenna has a rule engine to evaluate artifact rules and Antenna provides information and warnings about security issues.
